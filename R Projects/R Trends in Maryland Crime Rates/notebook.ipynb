{"cells":[{"source":"## 1. Maryland crime data\n<p>Crime rates vary across space and time. The reasons crimes are committed in some places but not others can be difficult to detect because of complex socio-economic factors, but policymakers still need to understand how crime rates are changing from place to place and from time to time to inform their policies.   </p>\n<p>Many government statistics, such as crime rates, come from nested datasets. Most US States are divided into counties (Alaska has “burrows,” and  Louisiana has “parishes”), and counties and county-level governments can vary within the same state. For example, one county might have a high population density and be urban, whereas a second county might have a low population density and be rural. </p>\n<p>In this project we will use a form of regression called hierarchical modeling to capture and explore <a href=\"http://goccp.maryland.gov/crime-statistics/\">crime statistics</a> collected by the State of Maryland to see if there is a linear trend in violent crime across the state between 1975 and 2016.
